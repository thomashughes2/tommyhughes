                    <p>Everything starts somewhere. A conversation, a project, a relationship—they all begin with a single moment, a single word, a single decision.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've been thinking about how we make things more complicated than they need to be. We plan and strategize and overthink, when often the best approach is just to start.</p>
                    
                    <p>This website is a perfect example. Instead of spending weeks planning the perfect design, I just started with something simple. Clean, minimal, focused on content. It's not perfect, but it's real.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's something beautiful about simple beginnings. They're honest. They don't pretend to be more than they are. They leave room to grow.</p>
                    
                    <p>Maybe that's the key—starting simple and letting things evolve naturally. Less planning, more doing. Less complexity, more clarity.</p>
