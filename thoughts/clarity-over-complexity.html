                    <p>In a world full of noise, clarity is a superpower.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've noticed that the most impactful ideas are often the simplest ones. They cut through the clutter and get straight to the point. No jargon, no unnecessary complexityâ€”just clear thinking expressed clearly.</p>
                    
                    <p>This applies to everything: writing, design, communication, problem-solving. The goal isn't to impress people with how smart you are. The goal is to be understood.</p>
                    
                    <p>Complexity is easy. Anyone can make something complicated. But simplicity? That takes real work. It requires you to understand something so deeply that you can explain it in plain language.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I'm stuck on something, I ask myself: "What am I really trying to say here?" Strip away the layers, get to the core, and express it as simply as possible.</p>
                    
                    <p>Clarity beats cleverness every time.</p>
